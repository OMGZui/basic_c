## 科普

```bash
int imax(int, int);
int imax(int a, int b);

the call
imax(3.9, 5.4)

becomes equivalent to the following:
imax(3, 5)

```

- Recursion

C permits a function to call itself

- Fibonacci

```c

unsigned long Fibonacci(unsigned n)
{
    if (n > 2)
        return Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2);
    else
        return 1;
}


```

`gcc usehotel.c hotel.c -o hotel.o`

- Finding Addresses: The & Operator

One of the most important C concepts (and sometimes one of the most perplexing) is the pointer, which is a variable used to store an address

- Pointers: A First Look

```bash
The declaration int * pi; says that pi is a pointer and that *pi is type int

a pointer really is a new type, not an integer type

Given pbarn = &barn;, *pbarn is the value stored at address &barn.

In short, a regular variable makes the value the primary quantity and the address a derived quantity, via the & operator. A pointer variable makes the address the primary quantity and the value a derived quantity via the * operator.
```
